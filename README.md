# My Spot Journal
It is my iOS app, which I recently built as an example. My Spot Journal was built entirely in Swift. The most important thing that code is readable, clean and it's quite easy to extend project.

In Spot Journal you can save new spots and rate them. Also try to get a route to them!

Thank You so much for taking Your time.
